1,Rider,"News, a visitor, or something approaching.","I always bring news, look around me to understand what it concerns. I may come to visit you or bring you some change. I am fast and always on the move. If you see a negative card near me you probably won't like the answer. The Lenormand Knight brings news. It is the first card and announces new things. In the Gilded Reverie deck we see a dreamy female knight sitting astride a carousel horse; the horse that in fairy tales is the bearer of messages. She could even be Iris, Greek goddess messenger of the gods. The sling bag across her shoulder may be indicative of further messages for different destinations along her nightly journey. In her hands she holds a white envelope, a letter that is outside the bag and is ready to be delivered and read in the envelope. The carousel is an ideal metaphor for how this card represents a new cycle that is starting and the end of an old situation. The up and down of the carousel also symbolizes the 'magic flight' that gives power to this messenger to reach his destination. Freed from the eternal spinning of the 'Carousel of Life', whose circular movements are also defined by the laws of physics as acceleration, our Knight, in a symbolic way, reflects the rhythm and speed of information by which our lives are more and more affection."
2,Clover,"Luck, happiness, or a small win.","I bring you happiness and luck. I make things better and as long as I have no negative cards after me I will turn your difficulties into opportunities. I am the beautiful surprises and happy sighs. This card depicts an explosive reverie of four-leaf clovers. Both clovers and four-leaf clovers, with white flowers, are set against the backdrop of an idyllic day. Everything is vibrant with green, fertile and promises of growth and fortune. The white of the flowers symbolizes the purity of luck. Wherever this card is, all is well. In the language of flowers, white is also known to be a symbol of remembrance; the card can mean that someone from afar is thinking of you. In Ireland the shamrock is commonly associated with luck. However, since the four-leaf clover has become less common, the act of finding one in nature is considered a very lucky event. The Four Leaf Clover is also known to be associated with love, passion and abandonment. Medieval poetry is full of passionate encounters between young lovers in fields of four-leaf clovers. So it can also mean being lucky in love. However, if the four-leaf clover falls near Sickle (10), expect the lucky of love to be short-lived!"
3,Ship,"Travel, movement, or journey.","I'm taking you on vacation or a business trip. You'll need a suitcase for where we're going. I'm known for distance and I'm constantly on the move. Look at the cards near me for clues and suggestions to the changes I bring on your life journey . A journey must be undertaken. There are new horizons to explore and preparation is necessary to ensure favorable transitions. In the original 'Game of Hope', in which we find the first publication of the Lenormand symbols, this is indicated as an auspicious voyage, so much so that the traveler will be 'happily carried by the ship to the Land of the Birds' . Promises well! In the Gilded Reverie this card is represented as a fantastic flying ship, an elaborate brig, which takes us to new sights and panoramas. While in the original card the image depicted a ship, in subsequent decks it was changed to long-distance transport depending on the fashion of the period, for example a train or a plane. Regardless it generally means long distance travel. The nature of the trip will usually be pleasant and very favorable, like a holiday for example, depending as always on the cards surrounding it."
4,House,"Home, family, or security.","I am your family and your foundation, your land and your home. I give you stability and comfort. I am your organization and your living environment. I am your surroundings and your possessions. The cards around me they will give indications on my present state or on what will be decided in the future. In this card a shrine must be found, showing us family and home. The sanctuary that offers us a refuge from the world. In the Gilded Reverie the paper is depicted in such a way as to lure us back home like the nostalgic places of childhood fairy tales. The house is built with gnarled roots that give the impression of a place of permanent fixtures and security. The open garden gate speaks to us of an opening that is made available. The house can be one of the most interesting ways to date a Lenormand deck, as each deck tends to both turn to the past and choose contemporary buildings to represent. Some decks show very functional buildings, others highly inspired manor houses. However it is depicted, it represents what we think of our home, our home, our security."
5,Tree,"Health, growth, or life.","I am here to stay and grow. I am the health of your body, your mind, your soul. Look at the cards near me to find out more about me. When there are negative cards, prepare some tissues for the your nose. It is a sign of health and longevity and is the imperative to put down one's roots to ensure a secure future. The presence of this card may indicate a hereditary health condition. Combined with the house card we have a 'tree house' which speaks to us of safety but at the same time of great family responsibility, and of the possibility of illness due to stress. The tree here is also depicted as The Tree of Life, a spiritual symbol that has its roots in the most ancient populations. Whatever the image of the tree - Babylonian, Egyptian or Jewish - it still speaks to us of antiquity and archaic roots. The meaning of the card can also be seen in the rainbow, perhaps suggesting that true health must be found by aligning ourselves between what is above and what is below. The harmony of colors reflecting through the tree symbolizes the holistic nature of healing and life itself."
6,Clouds,"Confusion, uncertainty, or temporary problems.","I am dark on one side and bright on the other. Conflicts and doubts I will surely bring you. You will not be able to see clearly, I will block your perception and let confusion reign. One thing I promise you for sure, however, is that I will pass, because the sun always shines again after the storm has passed. The card symbolizes forebodings and changes, and the negative or positive influence is expressed by the direction of the dark part of the cloud. The birds soaring on the right side of the card and the glorious breaking of the sun promise liberation from uncertainty. This card can also warn against obscuring a truth; There is a lack of clarity regarding a situation, something needs to be revealed. A revelation may be imminent. The darkest aspects of the card are found at the bottom left, where we see some lightning strike the tree of the previous card. This image reflects uncertainty and confusion. In some Lenormand reading methods the two sides of the card - the bright one and the dark one - are used to see if the confusion is before us or after us. In reverie we can also see if it is above or below us. This can be particularly useful in a reading of the Grand Tableau, where the diagonals are also looked at - a more advanced system of reading."
7,Snake,"Deception, complications, or a rival.","Be careful of me because I always hide. You cannot believe me or trust me. I cheat, deceive and betray you in an instant. Watch where you walk and what you step on, my fangs will definitely make you fear. In the Game of Hope it is clearly said to stay safe from the bite of this dangerous snake. You must be scared, very scared, as a betrayal can probably lurk in the cards near where this card is located. Beware of a superficial person, a person inclined to be mischievous, particularly when combined with the Dog card (18), which quite literally means that a cantankerous friend will harm you. False behavior and a two-faced individual can be a problem. The card warns you to be careful and watch where you step. Our Serpent here is found in an apple tree and also alludes to the Garden of Eden, in which there was the original interruption of the happy relationship that we have seen in previous cards, such as House (4). The Lenormands are firmly rooted in Christian tradition, for example the Cross (36) and even the Garden (20) were seen in the original game as biblical places. So be wary and look carefully at the cards next to the Serpent to find out what the nature of the evil/danger is in your situation."
8,Coffin,"Endings, illness, or transformation.","I am the painful change and transition. You will feel me through your body, your mind and certainly your wallet. Depression, loss and failure are my specialties. I am illness and bed rest. I am the end all things and sometimes death. The coffin of the Reverie deck recalls the ancient Egyptian period. Although it is traditionally seen as an end or finality, it is also a symbol of an initiation that leads us to a reevaluation of our life's purpose. It often happens that when we face life-changing events or illnesses they lead us to reevaluate the most important aspects of our existence. Here, in the world of Reverie, the Coffin is depicted in the form of a sarcophagus, flanked by the imposing figure of Anubis, the god of embalming and protector of the dead. One of his roles is to ascertain, by weighing the heart, the merit of people to enter the afterlife. The meaning of this card may be the actual end of something as we know it."
9,Bouquet,"Gifts, happiness, or an invitation.","I bring beauty and a happy face. I am the gift that warms your heart. I am your rest and well-being. No matter what card lies before me, I will always change it in a positive way. What is it like when someone gives you a gift? This card is a fragrant scent of joy and happiness, a demonstration of appreciation that is on its way. Here is an image of a bouquet of pink tulips that speak the 'language of flowers'. In the Victorian era, flowers were often used as a means of communication. They became lovers' code, a perfect way to secretly express love, passion and appreciation. Long before the Victorian period, the Tulip was highly esteemed and considered so desirable that it caused a phenomenon called 'Tulipomania'. Thus, the presence of this card signifies a precious gift that can be given or received. The fact that in the image there is a label containing the name of the deck is a reference to previous decks, which often had the publisher's stamp embossed on one of the cards. In many old Lenormands the flag of the publisher's city was found on the Ship card (3), for example. When combined with cards like the Knight (1) or the Letter (27), the bouquet becomes a beautiful invitation. Also together with Garden (20) it can mean an invitation to a party. With Torre (19) however it could be a less desirable invitation for a hospital appointment. At least you'll have flowers in your room."
10,Scythe,"Sudden endings, danger, or harvest.","For everything there is its time and time for every matter under heaven (Ecclesiastes, 3). Be careful, I'm fast and sharp. Cutting precisely, with sharp and clear vision. They are an accident, a deep cut, a break or sometimes a difficult decision that needs to be made. I can bring you a good harvest or danger. Look at nearby cards to see what I'm mowing down, it might just be your wages. This item is a simple agricultural tool used to clear grass and mow grain at harvest time. In the world of Lenormand it symbolizes a sudden trauma or shock that will take you by surprise. A quick and clear cut will be made. It is also dangerous, as much as it is sharp. You have to be careful where this card points, particularly in the Grand Tableau. Cards that are near the tip of the blade modify its influence, making it more or less extreme in its impact. For example, the Scythe near Cloverleaf (2) will make the shock less severe. It's almost as if the act of cutting the Four Leaf Clover (luck) blunts the blade. This symbol can also represent a 'call to action', particularly when combined with cards such as the Knight (1)."
11,Whip (or Broom),"Arguments, discussions, or repetitive cycles.","Be careful of the smoking mood, I bring conflict and discord. You will find me in competitions because I work with repetition. Arguments and arguments are my patent but I'm not always bad. You can find me at the gym or in a lustful bed on a whim. The Broom/Whip is one of the problematic Lenormand cards. Unlike tarot, in this deck there are cards that are clearly favorable and others that are clearly unfavorable. When the whip comes out the frenzy will increase, creating discord and causing people to become angry quickly. This card represents trouble, strife, disharmony, conflict, arguments, and all things stressful, especially if it is found near Birds (12). You can be the one to give a whipping or a whipping will be given to you. In the Reverie, a curved whip and a rod are depicted, a bundle of tightly bound branches that were used for repression and punishment. Rods were used in France during the French Revolution and in the time of Mlle Lenormand herself. In its most positive sense the card emphasizes putting your strength and attention together, to stay focused and get everything back in order."
12,Birds,"Communication, chatter, or anxiety.","phone call, a text or an appointment: this is what I communicate. You can find me in meetings, in interviews and I like to negotiate. I can be your brother, lover or friend. I also point out the couples. This card can be a symbol of gossip, gossip or the passing of information in a positive sense, although as always it depends on the cards around it. Many voices together make more noise than one; it can also be seen in modern crowdsourcing or mass communication. It can be as simple as an ad that travels fast or is distributed widely, especially when located near Knight (1). It also belongs to the ever-growing world of Facebook and Twitter. Card can also literally mean 'to tweet'. However, there may be communication difficulties similar to what happens during the 'wireless telephone' game. In fairy tales characters are sometimes given the ability to understand the 'Bird Language' and this may be why the card sometimes signifies a misunderstanding/non-understanding, particularly when found near Broom/Whip (11)."
13,Child,"New beginnings, innocence, or something small.","I'm young, I'm new, I'm playful and immature. I am a child, a teenager or a teenager. Small, short or tiny are other ways to describe me. The child is literally one of the character cards from the Lenormand world and indicates a young person. To be honest we can also take it as a symbol of a childish nature or someone who feels/is young at heart. No one wants to be read about business and advised to choose a young guy as a business partner; although perhaps, in certain cases, we will have to think/interpret it in a slightly less literal way. The Child is in a place of wonder, innocence, hope and has the ability to play something just for fun. It is another time and space where imagination is unfettered and reality is taken for what it is. It represents the early stages of development in which changes can be made and a positive future can be formed. The Reverie represents these wonders through the image of an open storybook on the first page - the one that begins with 'Once upon a time'; the remaining pages are blank and have yet to be populated. A fairytale castle can be seen with hope in the form of a rainbow - an image, that of the rainbow, which recurs throughout the deck, alluding to the original 'Game of Hope' from which all the decks of the Lenormand derive."
14,Fox,"Caution, deceit, or strategy.","When I'm not about your work, I'm the red flag that tells you that some ambiguity is coming. Look around you and within your circle, I may be planning your downfall. I am a master manipulator and I could deceive you completely. My cunning is famous and my game is very sneaky. In the original 'Game of Hope' it was written that the cunning fox leads the player off-road. This is the trickster card of the deck and its presence brings cunning and plots: whether for better or for worse depends on its position. The Fox here looks back at his prey - perhaps the cockerel thinks he is the only one who woke up so early. However, the Fox has already prepared his strategy and is sure of getting his bird. Around the time the Lenormand deck was conceived, there was a folktale called 'Reynard the Fox'. In this collection of stories Reynard was portrayed as a false prophet, and many traditional interpretations of the Fox card still carry this sense of 'false gospel'. So be careful of cheating and deception because the Fox in this deck is a symbol of these traits, and not only that: also be careful of the charmers who make you smile, not everything is what it seems! The Fox near Bouquet (9) can warn you of deception and flattery, and be even more wary if the Heart (24) and Scythe (10) cards also appear in the equation. In our Lenormands the literal way to read this card is deception and flattery lead you to a broken heart. You have been warned!"
15,Bear,"Power, authority, or finances.","They are power and strength, health and protection. Your finances are my domain and your food is my concern. My worst sides come out when you see negative cards around me. The polar bear is a fitting symbol of the indomitable dignity that is represented by this card, whether read as an authority figure, a protective mother, or purely as strength. The polar bear is the most powerful of all species. Furthermore, its color is representative of the pure spirit it embodies. The Bear can be related to a person who is in a position of power in the business world. The Bear can also be matriarchal. In China the polar bear is known to represent Russia. It can also be a symbol of bureaucracy and brute force. This card could also tell us to push something through pure strength. For example, an interesting combination is Bear+Bouquet (9), which could be read as a so-called iron fist in a velvet glove."
16,Stars,"Hope, guidance, or dreams.","Shimmering sparkles, guidance and healing is what I promise through a gentle touch. I am reassurance, inspiration and a new path for your explorations. Wish upon a star, for I bring hope and light from afar. In the Game of Hope we made progress along a Snakes and ladders* style map of life; and we have arrived at this point at the 'Star of good prospects'. Here we see the stars mapped onto a zodiac compass, indicative of life's true journey. The Stars in the Lenormands can be interpreted as a fixed course, something preordained. The Stars indicate the need for clear vision and fulfillment of desires. We have all heard the saying about someone 'he has stars in his eyes' (twinkle eyes) and that other saying 'you should follow your star'. Therefore it is a card of optimism and ambition; portends success and many promises. And you'll have to thank your lucky stars."
17,Stork,"Change, migration, or improvement.","With movements, upgrades and improvements I bring spring and the changing of the seasons. Sometimes I represent a new arrival in the family or simply a new evolutionary step. I can be your next move or your next promotion. The Stork is a predictable creature, although it is fabled to bring change (for example, with the arrival of a baby). In fact she comes home like clockwork to the same nest every year. The stork is a highly prized creature and is viewed with affection. Its return to the nest in the Spring period is the reason for the association with birth and delivery, which is its main meaning in the Lenormand world. Stork and Knight (1) will certainly bring news, even more so if they are combined with the Letter (27). The image evoked in the Reverie here depicts a pair of storks at home in their nests, with a blazing sun peeking through the clouds. They are looking in the direction of the Life-Giving Sun, one of the other cards in the Lenormand deck. The process of birth, life and finally death inevitably brings about changes. Depending on the cards surrounding it, the Stork can represent a change in lifestyle; for example associated with House (4) it tells us about a change of residence."
18,Dog,"Friendship, loyalty, or a companion.","Loyalty and friendship are what I represent. I am protection and trust, support and reliability. When I have negative cards around be careful and take a closer look. I could be your advisor, your pet or your best friend. Depicted here is the Dog, a reliable and faithful friend who can be trusted and who loves you unconditionally. The Dog is independent, is more than satisfied with his role and holds the lead, with a ball in the background, as if saying 'you know what you have to do'. It is a symbol of companionship. If this card falls near Gentleman (28) or Lady (29) it reassures us enough about their intentions. With the Ring card (25) to its right it represents a romantic relationship. The Dog in a reading can mean a close friend, a trusted person. He radiates his sense of loyalty and trust to the cards nearby; for example in combination with Letter (27) it could be a communication that can be trusted. Dog+Rook (19) can mean a company or authority that is taking care of something that worries you."
19,Tower,"Isolation, institutions, or legal matters.","Corporations, organizations, institutions and governments are under my influence. I am boundaries and restrictions, so be careful of isolation. I describe both your ambitions and your expectations, and let's not forget your superior education. Unlike in the tarot, the Tower in the Lenormand is a symbol of a structure that offers protection and security. In the 'Game of Hope' it is an observation tower built on a hill to monitor the countryside below. In these modern times it can be related to border controls or those in the passages between cities. It has multiple meanings, it can range from authority to education, from places of power to legal relationships. The Tower is also a seat of power and often signifies bureaucracy. When associated with the Letter (27) it is a dreaded form that must be completed, even worse if it is also accompanied by the Snake (7). Read the little clauses of that insurance policy carefully! According to some books it can be a symbol of a place of isolation, such as a hermitage. It also contains occult meanings and even the remote Tower of Reverie has this connotation. Sometimes it is within ourselves that the clock must turn."
20,Garden,"Social events, community, or gatherings.","When you have to go to a party, a concert or a business meeting I will definitely appear in your reading. You will find me at a meeting or a retreat, at a riot or on a picnic. I like crowds and public events, I fit in perfectly with everything related to your 'social network'. In Mlle Lenormand's time the park or garden was a social place, a meeting place. It was a space for hanging out and where relationships were strengthened through sharing and socializing. As in the Reverie, the card is often depicted with a cultivated garden with a fountain, perhaps a reference to Nuremberg, where the 'Game of Hope' first appeared. The card means 'public'; and although it might seem strange that there are no people in the image, it is only because it was the public space that was meant to be represented. When this card is read it adds the adjective 'public' to the cards in its vicinity. Garden+Tower (19) can mean a public organization; Garden+Diary (26) instead public education. It is best to stick to the literal reading of the Lenormands. This card can suggest the importance of being sociable and perhaps even tell you that you need to promote yourself more, particularly if it is combined with Moon (32). A contemporary meaning of this card, paired with Heart (24), could be online dating/meetings. If there is Garden+Heart (24)+Letter (27), in the 21st century this could represent the email you have been waiting for a long time."
21,Mountain,"Challenges, blockages, or delays.","come to bring you challenges and obstacles through blocks and resistance. I'll make you late for your appointment and with my coldness I'll take away your emotions. Be careful and be wary, I could be the enemy in your house. The Mountain is a symbol of obstacles present on our path. It may be here only to be conquered, as the animal that is observing it from below seems to want to do, but it is certainly in our way. In the Reverie the Mountain appears to us as an obstacle almost impossible to overcome, in accordance with its origins as a detour card, with the aim of making us slow down. In fact, when combined with other cards, it shows us that we must abandon our itinerary and start a new path. Mountain+Tower (19) is a delay by a government agency; Mountain+Cross (36) represents a completely uphill fight. Other cards of a similar nature are the Path (22), which offers a choice rather than a detour or delay; and the Stars (16) which offer good perspectives and clearer navigation."
22,Crossroads (or Paths),"Decisions, choices, or multiple possibilities.","Decisions and choices are what I offer. Alternative directions are what I hope for. I express myself through multiples and doubles and when I am in a relationship there can be trouble. The moment comes when you have to choose whether to follow one path or another; neither is right or wrong but only one can be taken. Here in the Reverie we have represented steps that can take us upwards and forward to the point of deliberation; stairs and steps are symbols of the ascent to a higher place, a better place, where, once you stand at the top before the doors that lead to the stars, the possibilities are endless."
23,Mice,"Loss, theft, or stress.","You don't want me in your house, you don't want me in your blouse. I bring loss, I bring theft along with destruction and decay. They are your stress and your anxiety, they are the worries in society. I am your annoyances and your plague, I bring disease into your nest. These mice are definitely happy with their work: the gradual destruction of heritage and resources. They are very busy gnawing on clothes, fruits and bread. They seem to have no regard for other people's property and gnaw rapidly while no one is looking. Mice are a symbol of losses or the reduction of one's savings - especially if combined with Pisces (34) - or even outright theft. Their presence brings a 'bite size' effect to the reading, something that happens in small pieces. That's not to say it's not a powerful card - these mice are delicious but not if you find them in your kitchen. They represent the nagging/annoying aspect of life, like when a problem arises, something that becomes like the plague and that simply doesn't go away and doesn't leave you in peace. And it leaves your mind troubled. This card can also warn you to keep your assets safe; Mice in Lenormands are terrible hoarders and can very likely represent theft."
24,Heart,"Love, emotions, or passion.","Love and happiness are drawn in my shape. I am your feelings and your emotions, your passions and your devotions. Just be careful that there are no negative cards around that could ruin this love and affection. In the ancient Lenormand decks the design of the Heart varies from an almost physical/biological one to a more romantic and kitsch one, embroidered with flowers and other ornaments. The heart is obviously a symbol of love and relationships. Here we see a heart formed by two swans, birds themselves symbols of courtly relationships, monogamy and lasting love. The Heart is a card that always brings benevolent emotions in Lenormands. Finding the combination of Heart with Four Leaf Clover (2) and Ring (25) promises love, luck, commitment and marriage. Heart together with Broom and Whip (11) and Scythe (10) however is not such a happy combination."
25,Ring,"Commitments, contracts, or cycles.","They are a precious object and are what binds in marriages and commitments. I am the one who brings harmony into unions as long as the negative cards stay away from me. They are the contract and the promise in associations and businesses. They are a symbol of completion and eternal devotion. The Game of Hope tells us that finding this ring will bring us a reward. Here we see a ruby ring to symbolize a commitment. In the language of crystals, ruby is a guarantee of economic stability - in certain cultures it was buried in the foundations of buildings to ensure good luck. The Ring is a symbol of commitment and can represent a contract in the making between two partners or two business associates. The Ring is an object of value to the wearer."
26,Book,"Secrets, education, or knowledge.","The book of knowledge, the book of secrets; what I host is educational and private. I can be your project or your research and sometimes your studies or your diary. Look carefully at the cards around me because with Sun you will be able to see inside me. I'm hidden, I'm unknown, but occasionally I can make you learn something you don't know. The Book focuses on the power of knowledge and the importance of possessing it. This card can suggest that there is something someone needs to know, although this will only become clear with the presence of other cards around. The Book is a vehicle for the imagination itself. In the Reverie it promises tales of great mystery throughout its pages. In order to be opened it has a mechanical device on its cover, thus reflecting the complexities of learning. The Book, in the depiction, opens on the right side of the card: this indicates the 'direction of learning' in reading - literally, what will be 'opened' towards knowledge, what will be taught. For example, if Dog (18) is to the right of the Book, you will learn something about a dear friend. The next card, still on the right, can indicate what will be learned, such as Ring (25) or Stork (17): it might be a surprise for them when you say Congratulations on your engagement! or Wow! A baby!, before they even tell you."
27,Letter,"Messages, documents, or information.","am a document, I am a message, I am information, I am a package. Sometimes I can be an invoice, a certificate or a test result. You can also find me as mail, newsletter or a prize. Look around me to find out more about what I stand for. The letter depicted here reports actual correspondence written by Mlle Lenormand, thus connecting her name and spirit to this deck. Although she never used the cards that later bore her name, there is no doubt that she would have been amazed and pleased to still be recognized today thanks to their continued use. The letter brings a connection - an intimate communication, a familiarity. The Letter indicates a communication that may not yet exist, a slow form of transmission that requires patience to create a connection. It is the Letter with Knight (1) that can hurry things along and, unlike Book (26), may not bring knowledge or novelty (like Knight) but rather simple recognition. The feather resting on the letter is a quill, which since time immemorial has meant truth and communication - always keeping us straight."
28,Man,A significant man or masculine energy.,"can represent the person reading the consultation, the male subject of your reading or the male partner of the subject of the reading. Gentleman can represent the male consultant, the female consultant's partner/interest or the male consultant's partner/interest in the case of same-sex relationships. An elegant looking man sits in a chair holding a rose in his hand. He seems to be waiting for his partner (or partner). In the background a window illuminates the scene, which is otherwise unadorned. It speaks to us of waiting, patience and quiet resistance. The atmosphere of the scene communicates romance. He looks to the left of the card."
29,Woman,A significant woman or feminine energy.,"can represent you reading, the female subject of the reading or the female partner of the subject of the writing. Representative of the female consultant, the male consultant's female partner/interest, or the female consultant's female partner/interest in a same-sex relationship. A woman looks up from her book, her thoughts wandering. There is a commonality of atmosphere and mood that connects this woman and this card to her male counterpart. The red rose provides an additional point of connection that binds them. It is a sign, a gift, something done and received. Something shared."
30,Lily,"Peace, maturity, or sexuality.","Calm, peace and serenity are what I preach. Under my symbol I show your parents and elders. I bring wisdom and experience. I can mean a long-term relationship or ancestry. Happiness and satisfaction are my goal. The lily, according to a pagan vision, is a symbol of sensuality and passion, but also of purity. It can also represent motherhood. As a result, these calm-looking flowers, with their etched stained glass in the background, reflect a range of interpretations. The fact that they are still growing but at the same time eternally captured in the smooth glass, without their essence, shows the two sides of this card. We might suggest that it represents a certain range of possible arousal: sexual, nurturing, or the absence of arousal itself, as in chastity. As a card this Lily makes neighboring cards pure and simple, or it can excite their nature. The combination Lily+Bear (15) could certainly indicate, in a given situation, a mother or a powerful maternal figure, depending on the question."
31,Sun,"Success, positivity, or enlightenment.","am success, hear me roar! I control your ego and your charisma, I increase your confidence and courage. I bring victory and glory, but be careful not to be too bold or you may be burned by your own arrogance, like Icarus. The solar face represented (as in the following Moon card) contains the essential nature of this card, that is, blessing, success and great luck. We also see the passage of time present. In fact, the Sun marks the passage of the hours and the shadow falls over the number six, a solar number. The Sun shines and everything under its light grows. The cards around him, in a reading, are well supported and promising even if he is at the end of a line of cards. The light that this Sun card gives off is energizing and revitalizing. It can also mean the security/self-confidence that one needs to have to come out into the open to start with a project or to take a new direction."
32,Moon,"Emotions, intuition, or reputation.","Love and romance, intuition and psychic abilities, imagination and creativity are just some of the meanings I represent. I cross the sky and influence the waters, I am admired everywhere, I bring fame and honor. In the Reverie the Moon card is depicted in a waxing phase, while holding its various natural cycles between its horns, from the new Moon to the full Moon. Below her is a mechanical planetarium, indicating that her nature is affected by the mechanisms of the universe. The Moon card does not match the brilliance of the Sun, it is inherently more watery and really wants to become a 'Star' - to be recognised. Think of the emotional Sirens of the big screen (=famous film actresses), who are guided by intuition and method and who experience emotions as part of the game in order to act. This produces great creativity but can also create victims, such as Marilyn Monroe. The Moon brings emotional illumination. However she only truly flowers in close proximity to the Sun (31); in fact, the powerful energy that the Sun emits is needed to make it shine in the world to its full capacity. In the Lenormand tradition the Moon represents the recognition that comes to us from others and which is reflected on ourselves. It's also fame and notoriety. It only illuminates what others project onto it so when it appears in a reading, careful thought is required."
33,Key,"Solutions, opportunities, or discoveries.","Discoveries and solutions are my forte. You will find me in synchronicities, signs of destiny and fate. When I fall next to you you will know that you have the keys and the answers to the problems you are facing. Look to my right, I point towards the most important things or towards what needs to be solved. The solution to a problem can be found when you are in possession of the Key card, which can either unlock or protect, depending on which side it is flipped to. The answer is within your reach, this is a card of liberation, although it can also be an instrument of imprisonment. The Reverie's golden bird cage tells us about a cage that can become a prison. Inside is a rose that symbolizes mystery - a mystery that is revealed when the key unlocks it. It is also definitely a symbol of love, the most common of all mysteries. This card can affect many other cards; near Heart (24) can unlock feelings and be the key to your heart, near Book (26) can unlock knowledge, and so on. It is a card that offers many opportunities and new beginnings."
34,Fish,"Abundance, business, or flow.","bring copiousness and abundance. I deal with trades and sales. I support independence and promote business and self-confidence. Water, expansion and current are my department. Be careful to maintain the balance between being tipsy and being overloaded, you don't want to end up bloated and dizzy. Pisces in the Lenormand symbolizes resources and money. The three fish in the blue depths depicted here show that we can dive deep to gather food and abundance. In some traditions the card also represents well-being. When this card comes out it teaches us how to make the most of all the resources we possess. In modern language it means 'speculate to accumulate' or that starting from a small step you can go a long way. The exact meaning will depend on the cards around it."
35,Anchor,"Stability, grounding, or long-term.","With stability and security I bring peace of mind. I push you to persevere and help you achieve your goals. Beware of negative cards, they can shackle you and pull you down into a hole. In the card instructions of the original game that was the Lenormand model, this is the most important 'sheet' of the entire game, which led to winning the game and the entire amount of the pot or deposit. The Anchor is traditionally a symbol of hope (or faith) and comes before death -Cross (36). The Anchor offers stability and security; be confident that your hard work will pay off in the long run. The Anchor in the Reverie is adorned with two fish, symbolizing abundance and well-being. This is a guarantee card. You are protected in times of need."
36,Cross,"Burdens, challenges, or faith.","am the bearer of pain, sadness, burdens and trials. Punishment, suffering and guilt are the areas of my expertise. I demand cries, tears and laments and I ask for prayers and supplications. When positive cards come out to my right then you may not have to feel too much fear. The Cross in the Lenormand is a symbol of a state of suffering, universal and inevitable. It is the condition of bearing the burdens of others, of those who are not responsible for their own actions, the cross we must bear. This card reminds us to take our responsibilities, whatever the cost. The positive side is that, with all this, redemption can be achieved - it depends on the cards he has around him."
37,Time,"Duration, cycles, or timing.","My appearance underlines the importance of 'time'. I might get close or I might pass, so be careful. Use me wisely to foresee the prospects. Look around me to better understand my implications. Certain cards may slow me down but sometimes quick action will crown you the victor. The clocks in the Gilded Reverie are symbols of the measurement and measurement of time. The clock is ticking and life is transitory by nature, so we should savor every moment of it and live life to the fullest. This card is a reminder of our immortality; the hands of the clock will only move forward in time and we must continue regardless. It is the card of time management and the owl reminds us to use it wisely. The contextualization of time in a reading is usually extrapolated from card details, numerology, or other methods. But this card can nevertheless bring further attention to this, as it highlights the importance of time in the interpretation itself. It can increase the range of perspectives, from a need to act immediately to the benefits of a patient 'sit and wait' approach. It may also suggest that you need to dedicate more time to yourself. This card can indicate a long period of time if it is near 'slow' cards such as Anchor (35), Tree (5), Lilies (30) or Mountain (21). It can mean a short period of time near 'fast' cards like the Scythe (10), The Broom and the Whip (11) or the Maiden/Boy (13). Many ways of representing time are depicted on the card: a cuckoo clock, a sundial, an hourglass, a cockerel, a candle and many other dials and devices. The clock casts shadows of time in the background alluding to the idea that 'time waits for no man'. It may be useful to compare it to the natural passage of time of the Sun (31) and the moon (32)."
38,Bridge,"Connections, transitions, or overcoming obstacles.","Close or far, wide or narrow, steep or straight are some of my characteristics. But in any form they are your connection to places, people, or points in time. I can extend the spaces that separate you. I can shorten distances to bring you back together. A symbol of transition and overcoming obstacles, the Bridges card finds a way to overcome divisions and in doing so opens up new opportunities. This card is a significant addition to the Lenormand deck as it offers solutions to problems by helping to 'close the gap/bridge a gap'. For example in the combination Cross (36) + Bridges (38) = suffering overcome. However, if the Bridges card follows other combinations, it can warn you not to 'burn your bridges', meaning there is no going back from decisions you have made. The Gilded Reverie Bridges card crosses impossible mountains. It is mitigated by the Mountain card (21) and can offer new paths, indicated by the surrounding cards. The card signifies reconciliation, connections or building bridges between people. The bridge is also a place for appointments, short breaks and meetings. If combined with Tempo (37) it indicates a very fast meeting; and with Letter (27) and Ring (25) it suggests a quick resolution of a contractual issue."
39,Dice,"Risk, chance, or unpredictability.","am the risk you choose to take, the gamble you decide to take. I am the uncertain and an act of faith. I offer the promise of future change. With negative cards on my right I will probably predict an adverse fate for you, but with positive cards I will lead you to happiness. Do you feel lucky? Well, are you? The two dice bring an element of change, opportunity and possibility; a new element to introduce into the situation. They signify randomness and a risk that you choose to take, unlike the Four-Leaf Clover (2), which speaks of luck arriving unexpectedly. Random dice rolls can both punish and reward, and can affect surrounding cards. The trusty Dog (18) is soon distracted from his duties if the dice roll near him. It could certainly indicate a friend you don't trust much. Alternatively, the dice card can signal a playful attitude, as well as fun and games. It can also suggest risky behavior, such as gambling. The image of this card appeared in early games similar to the Lenormand prototype, and therefore also refers to the history of the deck, which was originally a game played with dice and cards. The dice are now incorporated into the deck, just like the meanings of the cards; instead of being relegated to a book of destiny, as originally happened."
40,Mask,"Deception, facades, or hidden intentions.","Look deep inside your soul, are you playing for whose entertainment? I balance contradictions and contain opposites. I highlight your emotions or hide them. When I appear on your right I bring joy to light but if I am on your left then melancholy is in sight. I can play any role, truth or disguise... I am your creation. The Mask card speaks to us about playing roles. It may indicate the need to take on a different role. It is a symbol of deception and concealment. It is different from Fox (14) or Snake (7) because its appearance indicates something that seems like what it is not. The card can be a warning about not judging something or someone by their 'cover' and not trusting appearances. In combination with Knight (1) it means misleading news. If it falls near Lady (29) or Gentleman (28) the person may be fake/an impostor -someone who shows one face but hides another. It is much more common than Fox and Snake and can be applied to any situation or card in the deck, depending on its proximity. In online communications 'Masquerade' is a term used to indicate a security risk, when someone steals your identity online to defraud. If it is located near Mouse (23) and Letter (27) this card can mean stolen identity."
41,Well,"Depth, wisdom, or an untapped source.","have multiple symbolic meanings: desires, resources, creativity and healing. If you look intently into the depths of my darkness you may see your true thoughts reflected and your secret desires revealed. But your wishes will only be fulfilled if you dig deep and work hard. The Well card speaks to us about looking deeper into a problem. Maybe you think you know everything about the situation but there may be more that you're not seeing. The image suggests hidden depths. The rope entering the well represents the importance of maintaining one's center. On a deeper level the Well card can be a sign that you have hit rock bottom and now the only way is up. If other cards nearby indicate that you have faced difficulties, now is the time for healing. The Well card also has to do with wishes but comes with the warning 'Be careful what you wish for'. Be prepared to work hard to get what you want. This card can also refer to an achievable goal but which requires even more effort or the use of additional resources. Unlike the Four Leaf Clover card (2), which brings unexpected luck, the Well reminds you that you must plan and work hard for your results. While the card can encourage you to use untapped resources, it can also urge you to be cautious about draining all your resources in one fell swoop. If the Well appears near Fish (34) or Boat (3) the advice may be not to overburden yourself too much in search of a profitable investment or deal."
42,Compass,"Direction, guidance, or seeking a path.","I'm here to help you find your way, whether there's a journey to take or a choice to make. I can provide you with directions and a path so you don't wander aimlessly. The Compass card is an indicator of the direction a person is destined to follow. It can represent something or someone who provides you with guidance and help to help you achieve a goal. This card urges you to examine the attention you put into your commitments. Look where the needle is pointing. Other cards nearby can give you guidance on your direction and destination. If you have Mountain (21) or Path (22) next to you you need to stop to orient yourself and study a plan. This card warns you not to proceed blindly, without direction. You need to know where you are going but also why you are moving and what you expect to find. The Compass card represents the many things that can guide you on your journey. It reminds you to take note and look out for signs and symbols you may see along the way. Pay particular attention to cards related to travel and movement such as Knight (1), Ship (3), and Stork (17). The Compass can also indicate feedback that other people offer you. Listen to your instincts to determine who might represent your 'true north' and who might be too eager to give you advice and take control. You can listen to other people's suggestions but you don't always have to follow them. Look to Key (33) and Stars (16) for further clarity and guidance."
43,Labyrinth,"Complexity, seeking solutions, or confusion.","When you think you've done everything you need to do, you hit a wall and have to start over. I am the Labyrinth that keeps you going through trial and error, until the end. There is no shortcut to success, my friend. This card speaks to us about making our way through a confusing stream of events, often through trial and error. You may have goals and destinations you want to reach but getting there may be more difficult than you expect. Yours is not a straight road but has twists and turns. No matter how much you have planned and how many strategies you have developed, at some point you will be faced with inevitable mistakes. Be prepared for some false turns and dead ends to come. The Labyrinth card directs you to retrace the steps already taken, if necessary, to take different itineraries. Sometimes there simply isn't a direct path. Regrouping and starting again is not a failure, it's all part of the process. Even if you feel like you're back to square one you'll be able to start over with new information and a better understanding of the landscape. The Labyrinth card can mean that a problem or puzzle requires rational deduction to solve. There are no easy answers or shortcuts. A limited point of view won't let you see the bigger picture. You may also notice that this card shows more than one person. It's a reference to the fact that you're not walking this path alone. Others are facing the same challenges as you and may be able to help you come up with a solution. This card can also represent your frustrating attempts to connect to others. Something can keep you distant from people or goals. This is not the time to turn your back on others. When calculating your next move, think not only about how you can proceed individually but also how you can help find group solutions."
44,Magnifying Glass,"Investigation, focus, or scrutiny.","They are the card that suggests you take a closer look or two. If you have already looked and still don't see clearly I can provide you with better focus and a new perspective. This card suggests the need to take a closer look at a problem you are having. Now is the time to focus, pore and analyze. You may overlook something that isn't clear or even visible. The most insignificant details can be of vital importance. Use the Magnifying Glass to help you investigate and discover more information that can lead you to greater clarity. In a reading the card on the left represents what it looks like to you, how things appear, before you take a closer look. The card on the right suggests what will be unearthed after you look closer. This card may be a warning that not everything is what it seems at first glance. Be careful to read all the characters, even the smallest ones. If this card appears next to Letter (27), Book (26) or Ring (25) it may mean that you need to examine documents, contracts, information or commitments more carefully. With the Clouds card (6) nearby it reinforces the idea that matters are still murky. This card could also indicate a financial audit or legal investigation. In the emotional/sentimental context, the magnifying glass indicates a worry; you may be too focused on something. Your obsessive thinking may be what is obscuring your vision."
