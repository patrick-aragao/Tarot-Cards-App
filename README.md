## Tarot Reading App is a Coapstone Project from Stanford - TECH 14 From Data to Deployment: Creating Production-Ready Large Language Model Applications

Using python,tkinter and openai my idea was to build a simple app capable of answer users questions using knowledge of Tarot, most specifically the Gilded Reverie Lenormand Tarot Deck.

The app also apply basic knowledge of LLM to coomunicate answer to the users in Natural Language and uses RAG to interpret the meaning of the cards connecting with users questions.

--> Make sure to use your own OpenAI API Key

For a better experience please include your name, question that you want the cards to answer and follow app instructions.

The meaning of each card according with the Deck Manual will be provided as well a LLM interpretation.
